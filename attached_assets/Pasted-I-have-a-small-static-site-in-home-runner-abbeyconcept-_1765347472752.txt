I have a small static site in /home/runner/abbeyconcept-main with index.html, services.html, styles.css and script.js. Please scan the entire repo and produce a complete production-ready upgrade + multi-page expansion and a build pipeline. Follow these tasks exactly and commit changes to files in-place:

1) Repo analysis:
  - Read every file and summarize the tech stack and any likely JS/CSS frameworks used.
  - List missing pages referenced by navigation and create them if absent.

2) Create missing pages:
  - Add these pages if they aren't present: pricing.html, automation-tools.html, virtual-use-cases.html, contact.html, about.html, blog.html.
  - Each new page must:
    - Use the same header/footer/navigation as index.html,
    - Have unique H1 and meta tags,
    - Include a placeholder main section relevant to the page name.

3) Accessibility & SEO:
  - Ensure `<html lang="en">` and proper meta viewport exist.
  - Add meta description tags and Open Graph tags to all pages.
  - Generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.

4) Performance & "10x loaded" improvements:
  - Inline critical CSS (above-the-fold) in each HTML head, move the rest into `styles.css`.
  - Add `<link rel="preload">` for the font(s) and any large critical resources and add `<link rel="preconnect">` for external domains used (like Google Fonts).
  - Add `defer` or `async` to non-essential scripts and mark large images with `loading="lazy"`.
  - Minify CSS and JS in a `npm run build` pipeline (esbuild or terser), and minify HTML into `dist/`.
  - Add a small service worker for offline caching and an HTTP caching policy (Cache-Control meta comment in README).
  - Optimize any SVGs or images using SVGO instructions and add WebP fallbacks if images exist.

5) UX / new features ("10x loaded features"):
  - Add a responsive mobile-first layout tweak if necessary (improve nav toggling).
  - Add a reusable hero component section and a component-style card for services that can be reused across pages.
  - Add a light "site search" (client-side) that indexes page headings & shows results (small JS).
  - Add contact form markup that POSTs to `/api/contact` (explain how to wire serverless endpoint or Netlify Forms).

6) Dev & Deploy:
  - Add package.json scripts: `dev` (serve), `build`, `format`, `lint`.
  - Add `.gitignore`, `README.md` with instructions and a sample `replit.nix` or Replit start command.
  - Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow `ci.yml` that runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` and can deploy to Netlify (optional).

7) Output & Diff:
  - For each file changed, show a unified diff patch and explain in 2-3 lines why you changed it.
  - Put built output in `/dist` when `npm run build` is executed.
  - If you cannot perform an action (e.g., real image optimization requiring external network), explain the missing step and provide exact commands the developer should run locally.

Make changes directly in the repo when possible. Keep everything static (no backend required) and keep dependencies minimal. After finishing, run `npm run build` and show a list of files created in `dist/` and the sizes.
